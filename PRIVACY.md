## My Promise on Privacy

Here, you're more than just a visitor; you're a guest. I don't collect any personal info about you. I don't have it, don't want it, can't lose it.

However, I do use some third-party services which might collect data on their own. I've done my homework to let you know who they are, detailed in the [Third Parties](/PRIVACY/#third-parties) section. For specifics on what they gather, I encourage you to reach out to them directly.

## First Party

### Performance Cookies

To understand how my site performs and constantly improve your experience, I use Google Analytics. I keep tracking to a minimum, in fact here is all the details I actively track:
- **Page Views**: I monitor which pages you visit and how you got there, helping me understand your interests and navigate my site more smoothly.
- **File Downloads**: If you download something, I take note of a few details to see what content resonates with you. This includes file type, name, link attributes, and where the link leads.

### No Ads Here

You won't find ads on my site. Your attention is precious, and I'd rather we keep our interactions genuine, without distractions.

## Third Parties

I do lean on some third-party services for website hosting and analytics. Here's the lowdown:

### GitHub

This site is hosted on GitHub Pages, which may collect identifiers, cookies, and website usage data. If you have specific questions about GitHub's data collection practices, their privacy policies can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies). 

### CloudFlare

This site is served from behind CloudFlare services, which may collect identifiers and usage data. Read CloudFlare's [privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) for more information.

### Google Fonts

I use Google Fonts to enhance the visual appeal and readability of my site. While Google may collect usage data, Iâ€™ve chosen fonts that align with both aesthetic and performance considerations, ensuring a seamless experience for you.

### Other Third-Party Insights

My site may include third-party embeds or links. It's a heads-up that their privacy practices will apply when you visit them. While I choose these services carefully, your privacy controls are in your hands when navigating away.

## The Bigger Picture

While I aim to minimize tracking, interactions with external sites through links or embeds on my page might track you based on their methods. It's part of the broader web ecosystem, and I encourage you to be aware of these practices.
